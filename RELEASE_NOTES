Kill wayland client if necessary When a pxWayland instance is destroyed, it stops and destroys its Westeros compositor instance and this will usually trigger the exit of any client process attached to the compositor.  It is possible that the client will not exit, however, so code is added to explicitly kill the client process if it does not exit on its own. Add some pxWayland unit tests.
